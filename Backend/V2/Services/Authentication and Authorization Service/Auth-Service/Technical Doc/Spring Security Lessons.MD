## Introduction to Spring Security

Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.

## Security Filters

Spring Security is built on a chain of filters, each responsible for a specific security function:

- Filters in Spring Security intercept incoming requests and outgoing responses.
- They can modify or reject requests based on security rules.
- Filters are arranged in a chain, with each filter passing the request to the next one if it doesn't complete the request processing.
- Common filters include:
    - `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` for form login
    - `BasicAuthenticationFilter` for HTTP Basic authentication
    - `OAuth2LoginAuthenticationFilter` for OAuth2 login

## Authentication Types

### Web-based Authentication

- Typically used for browser-based applications.
- Often maintains session state on the server.
- Common methods include:
    - Form-based login
    - OAuth2 login with redirect flows
- Usually requires CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.

### API-based Authentication

- Used for stateless clients like mobile apps or single-page applications (SPAs).
- Typically stateless, with each request containing authentication information.
- Common methods include:
    - HTTP Basic Authentication
    - Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT)
    - OAuth2 with token exchange

## Configuring Spring Security

### Web Authentication Configuration

For web-based authentication:

```java
http
    .formLogin(form -> form
        .loginPage("/login")
        .permitAll()
    )
    .csrf(csrf -> csrf.enable())
```

- Enables form-based login
- Specifies a custom login page
- Enables CSRF protection

### API Authentication Configuration

For API-based authentication:

```java
http
    .httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults())
    .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())
```

- Enables HTTP Basic Authentication
- Disables CSRF protection (as it's typically not needed for stateless API requests)

## OAuth2 Integration

OAuth2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service.

### OAuth2 for Web-based Requests

Process:
1. User clicks "Login with Google" (or another provider).
2. Application redirects to the OAuth2 provider's login page.
3. User authenticates with the provider.
4. Provider redirects back to the application with an authorization code.
5. Application exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens.
6. Application creates a session for the user.

Configuration:

```java
http
    .oauth2Login(oauth2 -> oauth2
        .loginPage("/oauth_login")
        .authorizationEndpoint(authorization -> authorization
            .baseUri("/oauth2/authorize-client")
        )
        .redirectionEndpoint(redirection -> redirection
            .baseUri("/login/oauth2/code/*")
        )
    )
```

### OAuth2 for API-based Requests

Process:
1. Client (e.g., mobile app) initiates OAuth2 flow, often using a web view.
2. User authenticates with the OAuth2 provider.
3. Provider returns tokens to the client.
4. Client includes the access token in the Authorization header for API requests.

Configuration:

```java
http
    .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2
        .jwt(jwt -> jwt
            .jwkSetUri("https://your-auth-server/.well-known/jwks.json")
        )
    )
```

## Custom Token Generation and Usage

After OAuth2 authentication, you might want to generate your own tokens for API usage:

1. Receive OAuth2 tokens from the provider.
2. Validate the OAuth2 token and extract user information.
3. Generate a custom token (e.g., JWT) with necessary claims.
4. Return this custom token to the client.
5. Client uses this token for subsequent API requests.

Example token generation:

```java
String token = Jwts.builder()
    .setSubject(username)
    .claim("authorities", authorities)
    .setIssuedAt(new Date())
    .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 864000000)) // 10 days
    .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS512, secret)
    .compact();
```

## Best Practices and Considerations

1. Always use HTTPS for all authentication flows and API requests.
2. Implement proper token storage on the client side (e.g., secure storage for mobile apps).
3. Implement token refresh mechanisms for long-lived sessions.
4. Use state parameters in OAuth2 flows to prevent CSRF attacks.
5. Implement proper error handling and user feedback.
6. Regularly rotate secrets and keys used for token signing.
7. Implement rate limiting and other API protection measures.
8. Conduct regular security audits and keep all dependencies up to date.

By understanding these concepts and implementing them correctly, you can create a robust, secure authentication system for both web and API-based applications using Spring Security and OAuth2.
