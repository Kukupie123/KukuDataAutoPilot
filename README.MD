### Kuku Data Auto Pilot (KDAP) Description

Kuku Data Auto Pilot (KDAP) is a practical tool designed for organizing and managing data, with a strong focus on task automation and defining relationships between data sets. It helps users streamline their data handling processes through the following features:

**Key Features:**

- **Data Organization:**  
  Create "data boxes" to store data in an organized way. You can group similar data entries, making it easier to find and manage information.

- **Defining Relationships:**  
  Define how different data boxes relate to one another, and view these relationships to better understand how data sets are connected.

- **Data Importing:**  
  Easily import existing data into the app to integrate your current data management processes.

- **Task Automation:**  
  Set up automation tasks to perform actions automatically, such as decreasing stock in the "Inventory" data box when a new purchase is recorded in the "Sales" data box. These tasks can be triggered by specific events or started by the user, providing flexibility in managing your data.

- **Data Analytics and Visualization:**  
  This feature will be developed after the other features are implemented, offering basic prediction and processing capabilities, along with data visualization tools to help users understand their data better.
