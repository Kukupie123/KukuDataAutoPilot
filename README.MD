# Kuku Data Auto Pilot

**Kuku Data Auto Pilot (KDAP)** is a powerful **data management** and **automation** tool. It helps you:

1. **Organize and store data** efficiently across multiple databases.
2. **Create automated tasks** that respond to specific events or triggers.

KDAP streamlines your data processes, reducing manual work and potential errors.

**Examples:**

1. **Retail Inventory Management:**
   A shop owner uses KDAP to manage inventory and sales records. When an item is sold:
   - KDAP automatically reduces the item count in the inventory database.
   - It simultaneously creates a new entry in the sales record database.
   - If stock falls below a set threshold, KDAP can trigger a reorder notification.

2. **HR Employee Onboarding:**
   A company uses KDAP to manage employee information. When a new hire is added:
   - KDAP automatically creates entries in multiple databases (payroll, IT access, training).
   - It triggers the creation of a company email account.
   - KDAP sends notifications to relevant departments (IT, facilities, HR) for further actions.

# How It Works

1. **Create a Workspace:** Start by setting up a **Workspace** to represent a specific area or project, such as "Grocery Shop."
2. **Create Records:** Within the Workspace, create **Records** like "Inventory Record" or "Sales Record" to organize and manage your data.
3. **Create Tasks:** Set up **Tasks** to automate specific actions. 

   For example, you could create an "Individual Sale Task" with fields for "Item ID" and "Quantity Sold." When you enter the item ID and quantity, KDAP will:
   - Automatically add a new entry to the Sales Record.
   - Update the Inventory Record by reducing the quantity of the sold item.

# Tasks

Tasks are the core feature of KDAP, offering flexibility to suit different needs. There are two types of tasks:

1. **User-Triggered Tasks:** These are manually activated by the user. For instance, a task could be triggered to update sales and inventory records when a sale is made.

2. **Event-Triggered Tasks:** These tasks are activated by specific events. For example, in a grocery shop workspace, you can create a task that automatically removes an item's entry when its quantity reaches zero or below.
